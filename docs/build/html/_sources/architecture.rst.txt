C4 suggests we look at Context, Container, Component, Code.
For more information on the Context, see :ref:`context`.

This chapter provides an `Architecture Summary`_ with an overview of the
architectural principles.

The `Container View`_ is pretty small. This is a simple set of applications to run on a desktop computer.

The `Component View`_ section provides an overview of the package structure
underlying the application software.

The `Processing Model`_ section provides an overview of the various kinds of processing that occur.

`Appendix I`_ contains the 57 distinct segment types.

The details of Code are covered in :ref:`design`.

Architecture Summary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two distinct "levels" or "views" to this application.

:Developer:
    These are the tools to create and test the message class definitions.
    This defines X12 message types as Plain Old Python Object (POPO) classes.

:Application:
    A message is implemented as class in a module.
    The class is used to unmarshall and marshall the text of messages in a variety of formats.
    Often, this is "exchange" format to Python and Python to JSON conversions to parse a message and persist an easy-to-use copy.
    It can also be JSON to Python and Python back to "exchange" format to create messages usable by other EDI applications.

Developer's Perspective
=======================

The X12 standard is defined via :file:`.SEF` files; additional
meta-definitions are used to manage the complexity.
These files are proprietary, and not freely available.

The PyX12 project has XML versions of these message definitions.

An X12 message can have a complicated structure of loops, segments, composites and elements.
This makes it difficult to define a message type, and parse text that serializes an instance
of a message type.

See :ref:`design.class` and :ref:`design.parsing` for more on solutions.

There are several steps in the interpretation of a message:

1.  The exchange format representation of a message. This is a big block of text.

2.  X12 Segments. It's relatively easy to decompose an X12 message into
    a sequence of segments and elements.

3.  The application's view of a Message that may be a Claim or Eligibility Request.
    This is a Python object definition that reflects the
    loops, segments, composites, and elements of the message.

X12 Message Definitions
-----------------------

There are two sources for X12 message definitions, in addition to the
customer's Implementation Guide.

-   The Python-based `PyX12`_ package. This package defines X12 messages using
    ``.xml`` files that seem to be reasonably complete.

..  _`PyX12`: https://github.com/azoner/pyx12

-   The SEF files. These seem to be a proprietary product of TIBCO.

The TigerShark tools can transform the ``.xml`` files
into JSON Schema and Python class definitions.


Application Perspective
=============================

An X12 Message is what the application uses.
It's a collection of X12 Segments.
The segment names are often reused, meaning
that a segment only has meaning in the context
of a specific Loop.

This leads to fairly complex navigation through the Loop/Segment/Composite hierarchy
within a message.

This navigation can lead to creation of properties to access specific attributes deeply nested within a message.
Because the message class definition is built from the XML (or SEF) source files, any
a property definitions added to the class could be lost.

A sensible solution is to make the class definitions "mixin-aware".

The :mod:`tools.xml_extract` tool should rely on a configuration file to look for messages that have additional
definitions, and include these definitions as mixins to the class.

This could lead to

::

    class MSG270(M270_Nav, Message):
        """HIPAA Health Care Eligibility Inquiry X092A1-270"""
        class Schema:
            json = {'title': 'HIPAA Health Care Eligibility Inquiry X092A1-270',
             'description': 'xid=270 name=HIPAA Health Care Eligibility Inquiry X092A1-270',
             'type': 'object',
             'properties': {'isa_loop': {'$ref': '#/$loops/ISA_LOOP'}},
             'required': ['isa_loop']}
        isa_loop: list[ISA_LOOP]

Where the ``M270_Nav`` mixin provides properties for navigation into the "2000" loops buried in the body of the message.

Container View
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is more-or-less a single container application. It parses messages and builds messages.

Component View
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The component packaging breaks into two major areas.

..  uml::

    package x12 {
        component base {
            component Source
            component Element
            component Composite
            component Segment
            component Loop
            component Message
        }
        [common]
        [msg_xxx_yyyy_zzz]

        msg_xxx_yyyy_zzz --> base
        msg_xxx_yyyy_zzz --> common
    }

    package your_app {
        [some_app]
    }

    some_app --> msg_xxx_yyyy_zzz


Here are some more details on the Python packages and modules.

-   :mod:`x12`. This is a package for handling the marshalling and
    unmarshalling of X12 messages.

    -   :mod:`x12.base`. This has the abstract base class definitions for all messages.

    -   :mod:`x12.common`. This has common data element and code definitions. This is built by the :mod:`tools.xml_extract` tool. Touching this is unwise.

    -   ``msg_mmm_vvvv_Xxxx...py`` modules with message definitions. These are built by the :mod:`tools.xml_extract` tool. Touching these is unwise.

-   :mod:`tools`. This package has applications to help define the message classes.

    -   ``xml_extract`` Converts the XML definitions to ``x12/msg_mmm_vvvv_Xxxx...py`` files.


Processing Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are several kinds of processing that are part of TigerShark.

-   The application processing includes multiple conversions between Exchange (the X12 text format),
    JSON and Python notation.

    -   `Unmarshalling`_ extracts useful Python objects from messages in Exchange or JSON format.

    -   An application can modify the Python or JSON message. An application can persist the JSON or Python notation, also.

    -   `Marshalling`_ builds a message in Exchange format or JSON from Python objects.

-   `JSON Schema`_ describes the JSON Schema formalization of the structure.
    This is how messages are described.

Unmarshalling
=============

See :ref:`unmarshall`.

An message class has a :meth:`parse` method for unmarshalling text to create Plain Old Python Objects.

Marshalling
===========

See :ref:`marshall`.

Each Message object handles marshalling into X12 text
or JSON.
A :meth:`dump` method handles X12 "exchange format".
A :meth:`json` method handles JSON.

JSON Schema
===========

The ``tools/xml_extract.py`` application, specifically,
reads XML files from the PyX12 project and creates modules with Python class definitions.
The Python can be used to build JSON Schema definitions.

The JSON Schema description of a message can be defined as

::

    some_message:
        type: object
        properties:
            loop1:
                $ref: #/$loops/loop1
            loop2:
                $ref: #/$loops/loop2

A loop can refer to segments using a more complex path

::

    $loops:
        loop1:
            type: object
            properties:
                segmentX:
                    $ref: #/$segments/loop1/segmentX
        loop2:
            type: object
            properties:
                segmentX:
                    $ref: #/$segments/loop2/segmentX

The ordinary nesting of referenced elements assures
the distinct definitions of a reused segment.

The JSON Schema representation of the message
definitions is handled via a large number of "$ref" references
from the overall structure to the definitions of loops, segements,
composites, elements, codes, and data element definitions.

The idea is that an overall message is generally
defined as follows:

::

    title: 227
    description: details of the 227 message
    type: object
    properties:
        isa_loop:
            "$ref": "#/$loops/isa_loop"

    "$loops":
        isa_loop:
            type: object
            properties:
                ISA:
                    "$ref": "#/$segments/isa_loop/ISA"
                gs_loop:
                    "$ref": "#/$loops/gs_loop"
                IEA:
                    "$ref": "#/$segments/isa_loop/IEA"

    "$segments":
        isa_loop:
            ISA:
                type: object
                properties:
                    ISA01:
                        "$ref": "#/$elements/isa_loop/ISA01"

    "$elements":
        isa_loop:
            ISA01:
                description: Authorization Information Qualifier
                type:
                    "$ref": "#/$datatype/I01"

    "$datatype":
        I01:
            x12_type: "ID"
            type: string
            minLength: 2
            maxLength: 2

This structure avoids deeply-nested constructs.
It permits reuse of the data types and codes.
It provides a loop namespace to disambiguate segments,
and their composites and elements.

Appendix I
^^^^^^^^^^

The following table identifies the 57 distinct segment ID's and how they are
used. When a segment ID has a list of segment types that indicates that the
segment appears in a number of distinct loops, often within a single message.

The worst case is the ``REF`` segment, which is used in a vast number of distinct loops and messages.
