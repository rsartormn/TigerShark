TigerShark handles semantically rich storage and modification of X12 formatted
data using Python objects.
This can be used for various EDI purposes, including medical claims
(837) and eligibility (270).

This package helps to create Plain Old Python Objects (POPO) which contain
to X12 structures.  No intermediate XML or other notation is used.
This can simplify X12 message parsing because the resulting structure is a Python object.

Additionally, JSON Schema definitions can be used
to describe the X12 messages for processing outside EDI software.
This can provide a handy representation for X12 data that can be processed by a wide variety of tools.

We'll look at Context, Container, Component and Code.
